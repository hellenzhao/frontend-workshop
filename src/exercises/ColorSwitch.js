/*
 * This ColorSwitch component renders a button. It's supposed
 * to change the page color. Wire it up to the onChangeColor
 * event handler prop it receives from the parent so that
 * clicking the button changes the color.
 *  
 * After you do this, notice that clicking the button also 
 * increments the page click counter. Your colleague who wrote 
 * the parent component insists that onChangeColor does not 
 * increment any counters. What else might be happening? 
 * Fix it so that clicking the button only changes the color,
 * and does not increment the counter.
